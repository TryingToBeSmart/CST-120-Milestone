# CST-120-Milestone
4/16/23 Milestone 7: Added Bootstrap dropdown that opens up a Bootstrap Form that posts info to postman in JSON format.  Everything is looking good with mobile or large computer monitor.  I like Bootstrap!

4/9/23 Milestone 6: Added Bootstrap menu and JQuery animations.

4/2/23 Milestone 5: Added events.js with events.  Learned how to use listeners to wait for things to happen on the page and then trigger events.  Updated Home and Map pages with some events.

3/26/23 Milestone 4: Added Flex box in the stylesheet.  Added container and child classes in the stylesheet to adjust the sizes of images and videos.  The items will wrap when the page becomes too small to see them on the same row.  They also have a maximum size and they have even spacing between them.  I really enjoyed learning about the Flex box!  Also added 'permanent marker' custom font to the home page from fonts.google.com.

3/19/23 Milestone 3: added external css stylesheet.  Added borders and shadows to images and videos.  Added slide animation and hover shadow for all links.

3/12/23 Milestone 2: added 4 new pages (Mountains, Gorge, Wa Coast, Hawaii).  Added several images, videos, and 1 sound from Zapsplat that autoplays ocean sounds for the Wa Coast page.  I think it is annoying if it were a live page (I hate it when live websites autoplay things, if I want it to play, I will click play :>), but it was good practice for me to know how.
TODO: I would like to learn how to adjust the 'map' page to use google maps with this tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/google_maps_intro.asp  I want to try to make highlighted locations on the map that also highlight the table contents that are connected, and add a link to the live Google map that links to the correct webpage(Mountains, Gorge, Wa Coast, Hawaii).

Due date 3/5/23 Milestone 1: First commit includes the beginning of the home page and map page.  This will expand over time to include a page for each area I have pictures for.  There will be options to click on the map to open up more webpages.  There will be separate pages for: Mountains, Longbeach, Columbia River Gorge, and Hawaii.
